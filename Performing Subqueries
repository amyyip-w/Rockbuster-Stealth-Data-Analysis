-- Finding the maximum amount paid for any movie in the Rockbuster database:

SELECT title,
       rating,
       release_year,

    (SELECT MAX(amount)
     FROM payment) AS max_amount

-- Finding movies whose rental rate is lower than the average payment made:

SELECT title,
       rating,
       release_year,
       rental_rate
FROM film
WHERE rental_rate <
    (SELECT AVG(amount)
     FROM payment);
     

-- Finding how many films are rated G, PG, or PG-13, and how many films are less than 100-minutes long:

-- Returning a list of customer IDs (which are multiple values) where the return date is earlier than July 29, 2005:

SELECT *

-- Finding the average amount paid by the top 5 customers:

-- Finding how many of the top 5 customers are based within each country:
